	If your business / product is about something, the best voice is usually a loud one. Have a product that&amp;#39;s killer? Please - for the love of everything holy in advertising - create content and get it out into the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The most engaging marketing sites I&amp;#39;ve seen in the past 3 years have been kinetic. Truly interactive. Rich-content-heavy.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether you&amp;#39;re a product owner, an agency, an entrepreneur... make compelling content and you&amp;#39;ll be rewarded. Trying to &amp;quot;drive engagement&amp;quot; and measuring the success of campaigns with press, shares, kudos, awards, and such? Great content makes it truly happen. &amp;quot;Driving engagement&amp;quot; for a stale brand is a waste of everyone&amp;#39;s time. Energizing a brand - regardless the product or service - always reaps more dividends in both short and long term for the brand and the creative producers involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It&amp;#39;s 2014. Stop worrying so much about your &amp;quot;Likes&amp;quot;. Generate content. Share w/ people that care and they&amp;#39;ll take it from there. Rinse. Repeat.&lt;/p&gt;
