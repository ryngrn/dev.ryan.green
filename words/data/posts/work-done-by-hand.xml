	Never underestimate the value of work done by hand. Sure, you can buy a website template from somebody that might fit your purposes. Will it do the job? Yeah. Will it make you stand out from the pack? Nope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Whether a good is tangible or if it is digital, you can rely on ingenuity, and craft as your most distinguishing factors in the marketplace. In a global economy, the only reason someone notices a new product from a new company is if its done better than anything preceeding it or if it&amp;#39;s done differently than anyone has done before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Why do people buy $30 bottles of artisinal olive oil? The handmade craft and high quality of the fair-trade olives. Why pay $50/mo for Ancestry.com? Because it&amp;#39;s better than any other resource out there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Take the time, scrape together the budget, and make something better than it&amp;#39;s ever done before. More likely than not, you&amp;#39;ll impress a few people. You&amp;#39;ll definitely be a better professional and a better person because of it.&lt;/p&gt;
