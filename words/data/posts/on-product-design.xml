	Making a product is easy. Really easy. Design based on what you think the app should have and make all the choices yourself. It&amp;#39;s unbelievable how quickly you can create something when selfishly designing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Making a product other people want to use is hard. Really hard. It seems like every choice you make as a designer can be made better, simpler, more elegantly. It&amp;#39;s all in the name of getting it right. Products that people want to use have gone through hundreds and thousands of micro-iterations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	At the end of the day, it&amp;#39;s best to lean on your design mantras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s not about you it&amp;#39;s about your users.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;It&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon for designers to confuse a beautiful looking product with one that works beautifully.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
