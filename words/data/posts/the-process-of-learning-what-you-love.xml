	Many people may say that they love the job they&amp;rsquo;re doing but how many people can truly say that they are doing what they love? Semantics aside, most people haven&amp;rsquo;t made the conscious effort to check and see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Learning what you know requires you to do many things you think you like but, in practice, don&amp;rsquo;t really enjoy. Humans do this all the time - thinking that they&amp;rsquo;d really love to sail around the world or get a job as an archaeologist and dig up dinosaur bones. Have they ever spent time learning about how to care for a boat and to work on repairing leaks or fixing engines / sails? Have they gone out to digs as a volunteer and weathered the heat and dirt for several 14 hour days in a row?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Seemingly, the only road to bliss is a painful one. Diving into what you want to do with full commitment and open mind is really the only way to see if it&amp;rsquo;s what you want to spend 40+ hours a week doing. If it&amp;rsquo;s not, persue the next thing you are striving to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In my career, I jumped from graphic designer to web designer to search marketing manager to ux designer to usability practitioner to jack-of-all-UI/UX-designers to front end developer to software engineer. I&amp;rsquo;m still in the learning process, but I am closer to knowing what I truly love to do than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Do what you think you want to do, and when that turns out to not be exactly what you want - pivot to something else. In a few years, I may go back to UX testing and product improvement. I may enjoy the application building process and wean myself off design. Only the future knows where the pain will guide.&lt;/p&gt;
