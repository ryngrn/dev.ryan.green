	We&amp;#39;ve had a good run. I&amp;#39;ve not turned bitter and stopped caring about users. I&amp;#39;m not changing careers. You&amp;#39;ve changed since we first met and I&amp;#39;m&amp;nbsp;done with the run-around that businesses and professionals often give me about the title. Let me elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Calling a Spade a Spade&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	most people that have UX in their job title are not actually UX&amp;#39;ers by definition.I get recruiter messages every week about &amp;quot;exciting UI/UX Designer/Developer&amp;quot; positions. If I ever ask for details, the descriptions are mostly identical - standard web designer or front-end dev... or both. Will I be doing user research? Continual enhancement based on testing or behavioral analytics gathering? User stories or journey mapping? No, no, and no... just low-level sitemaps, basic wireframes, and designs based on the wireframes. I&amp;#39;m sorry, but what&amp;#39;s overtly &amp;quot;UX&amp;quot; about any of these opportunities?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	User Experience is a Team Effort&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Working in an environment where you&amp;#39;re a formal User eXperience presence (a department, a position, et al), coworkers rely on you for being an advocate for the customer and being the voice of reason in design sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	UX isn&amp;#39;t a Verb&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
