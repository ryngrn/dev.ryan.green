	So there are some (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cooper.com/journal/2012/08/the-best-interface-is-no-interface&quot;&gt;like Cooper&lt;/a&gt;) who feel that the &amp;quot;best interface is no interface&amp;quot;... claiming that &amp;quot;No UI&amp;quot; is about the user and making things easier. They quote Don Norman and Kevin Ashton with quotes like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;If we had computers that knew everything there was to know about things&amp;mdash;using data they gathered without any help from us&amp;mdash;we would be able to track and count everything, and greatly reduce waste, loss and cost.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	After holding up Nest thermostats and Trunk Club as poster children, you might say that they are making sense. Except &amp;quot;No UI&amp;quot; doesn&amp;#39;t do away with the UI. These are learning systems that require less touching as your relationship with the product continues. What they&amp;#39;re missing is that these products still have a UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Timo Arnall did &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.elasticspace.com/2013/03/no-to-no-ui&quot;&gt;a great piece&lt;/a&gt; on why the whole &amp;quot;No UI&amp;quot; movement is silly, but I&amp;#39;ll go a step further. Claiming that one way of interface design is better than another is, sadly, a trap that people on messageboards and at conferences use to rile people up! What&amp;#39;s the best interface? IT DEPENDS! It depends on the client, their target audience, levels of complexity desired from said audience, education level of users, and so much more... it&amp;#39;s pretty much impossible to definitively say what might work best witout having other criteria to base your judgements upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In the end, &amp;quot;No UI&amp;quot; being the &amp;#39;best&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;wave of the future&amp;#39; is just as much bullshit as the skeuomorphism vs flat design arguement. Tread lightly when engaging in water cooler talks, fellow designers!&lt;/p&gt;
