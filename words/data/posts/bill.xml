	Bill -&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I just wanted to take the occasion of Father&amp;rsquo;s Day to reflect on the past few years and thank you for the example you&amp;rsquo;ve set and the impact you&amp;rsquo;ve made on me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From the time I asked for Andrea&amp;rsquo;s hand in marriage and you obliged, I knew that we were going to be family from here-on. Little did I know that I was going to marry into such a supportive and caring family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Without question, you&amp;rsquo;ve always been available&amp;hellip; whether it&amp;rsquo;s little things like a casual lunch and answering tax questions or bigger things like sharing life lessons. It gives me great comfort knowing that you&amp;rsquo;re there if I have a question or need to talk about anything.Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Through your example, I&amp;rsquo;m learning bits and pieces, experience by experience, how a great father handles himself. I aspire to follow in your footsteps when I have children of my own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	It is easy to go through life without letting loved ones know what a difference they make in your life. Just know that you&amp;rsquo;ve been more than I ever thought a father-in-law could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Ryan&lt;/p&gt;
