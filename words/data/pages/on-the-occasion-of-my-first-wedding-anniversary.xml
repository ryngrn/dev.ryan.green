	We&amp;#39;ve had a busy spring. A busy 12 months if you really think about it... finishing up school, freelance projects, the passing of my grandfather, getting a new puppy, job interviews, house hunting, weekend trips, planning a European vacation. Time has sped by - it really doesn&amp;#39;t seem like 12 whole months could have already passed us by!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	With so many things going on, it can be hard to stop and count your blessings. As far as first-years-as-a-married-couple go, I think that we&amp;#39;ve done pretty well. My wife is beautiful - even with her clinic clothes and name badge on. She&amp;#39;s supportive of me, even when I&amp;#39;m grumpy and working late hours. She went from not being much of a cook at all to regularly cooking delicious, healthy meals for the two of us in the span of a few months. She remains driven and focused on accomplishing whatever she can even now that classes are completed... even when she doesn&amp;#39;t have to. She&amp;#39;s a team player. I&amp;#39;m a lucky guy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We&amp;#39;ve had our ups and downs, our share of tear-filled nights, loud disagreements, and mean things said. We always come together in the end. If there&amp;#39;s anything more important in a marriage than being able to fight and make-up afterwords, I don&amp;#39;t know what it is!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	We show each other we care... we go on date nights. We get each other little gifts. Sometimes I surprise her with flowers or champagne just because. I just hope that she knows that I love her more than anything else in the world. She makes me happier than anyone else has in my life and I&amp;#39;m proud to call her my wife... no amount of flowers or bubbly can convey that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I guess I wrote all of that to say: &lt;strong&gt;Andrea, thank you for being the best wife a man could have &amp;amp; I love you&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
