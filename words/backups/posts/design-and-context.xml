	An interesting chain came through the Twitter feed recently. I&amp;#39;ve combined them below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-conversation=&quot;none&quot; lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;
		&amp;quot;I took a stab and redesigned twitter over the weekend&amp;quot; shows a lack of respect and understanding of what we do.&amp;nbsp;Also, not knowing the real problems/constraints really means they are just inventing their own contraints.&amp;nbsp;Retrofitting them to what ever looks good on a static mock. This is not what we do as designers.&amp;nbsp;They are not evil, and could be a great exercises for beginners. But the should not be glorified, instead should be kept as practice behind closed doors. I see them as tools to get attention, while demeaning our work.&lt;/p&gt;

	Man, I really agree. So often you see things on Dribbble like this - &amp;quot;My awesome Craigslist redesign&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Redesigned this weather app&amp;quot; - that are just nice static comps but show no thought when it comes to interaction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Well said, Yaron.&lt;/p&gt;
