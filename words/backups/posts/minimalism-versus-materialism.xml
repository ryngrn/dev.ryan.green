	I&amp;#39;m an idealist in most aspects of life. When it comes to &amp;quot;things&amp;quot;, I am constantly struggling with two issues. First, &amp;nbsp;the battle to rid myself of &amp;quot;stuff&amp;quot;. Second, the &amp;quot;not quite there yet&amp;quot; syndrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The items I love the most are those that are the epitome of &amp;quot;good design&amp;quot;. This also means that they are almost always expensive. The low-hanging fruit, I&amp;#39;ve already taken... but i often find myself researching &amp;quot;more&amp;quot;. I&amp;#39;ve got tons of instruments that I don&amp;#39;t play (I guess that makes me a collector) -- what good do they do me if I&amp;#39;m not using them? It&amp;#39;s better to have only one shitty guitar and be playing with people on a regular basis. I&amp;#39;ve got a nice car (VW Jetta) but I&amp;#39;m constantly looking at different, older ones that are &amp;quot;design icons&amp;quot;. Here&amp;#39;s an example of what I have in my head that I think I want:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Mercedes w460 and w/461 G-Class.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Land Rover Defender 110.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		1966 Ford F100&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		1960s Ford Bronco&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		Toyota FJ40&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		International Scout 80&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
		1968-1973 Porsche 911&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	The only vehicle on the list that makes any sense would be the 1966 F100, as it would be a 3rd vehicle. It adds something that none of the others do: a truck bed for hauling. For the F100 to make any PRACTICAL sense, it would need to be completely restored. Modern engine, no rust, new paint, new interior, new electrical... basically it would be a new vehicle in the design of a classic. To create a vehicle like this, you end up paying between $15k - $25k, which is what you would pay for a brand new model-year vehicle. Arguably, the custom-built vehicle will be built out of higher-quality materials to a higher build standard, but it is still a lot of money for a 3rd car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	This is the battle I fight all the time. The ideal? Have a 1973 Porsche 911 as my daily driver, Andrea driving a backdated MB G-Class, and an F100 as a 3rd vehicle. The reality? Porsches are finicky and a manual as a daily driver is annoying, Andrea doesn&amp;#39;t like the G-Class, and we have no room for a 3rd vehicle. Thus is life.&lt;/p&gt;
