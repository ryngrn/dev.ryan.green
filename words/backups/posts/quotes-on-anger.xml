	&amp;ldquo;Usually when people are sad, they don&amp;#39;t do anything. They just cry over their condition. But when they get angry, they bring about a change.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	― Malcolm X&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Bitterness is like cancer. It eats upon the host. But anger is like fire. It burns it all clean.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	― Maya Angelou&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Anger is just anger. It isn&amp;#39;t good. It isn&amp;#39;t bad. It just is. What you do with it is what matters. It&amp;#39;s like anything else. You can use it to build or to destroy. You just have to make the choice.&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
	― Jim Butcher, White Night&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;It is wise to direct your anger towards problems -- not people; to focus your energies on answers -- not excuses.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	― William Arthur Ward&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Most hatred is based on fear, one way or another. Yeah. I wrapped myself in anger, with a dash of hate, and at the bottom of it all was an icy center of pure terror.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	― Laurell K. Hamilton, Guilty Pleasures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Anger is a valid emotion. It&amp;#39;s only bad when it takes control and makes you do things you don&amp;#39;t want to do.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	― Ellen Hopkins, Fallout&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Get mad, then get over it. &amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	― Colin Powell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;There is nothing worse than having an enemy who is a total loser. It&amp;#39;s incredibly frustrating when seeking revenge against one, because you come to the realization that there is really nothing you can do to make the person&amp;#39;s life worse than it already is. They have nothing to take, there is no way to screw them over if you have been their victim. It&amp;#39;s maddening.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	― Ashly Lorenzana&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Sensitive people usually love deeply and hate deeply. They don&amp;#39;t know any other way to live than by extremes because thier emotional theromastat is broken.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	― Shannon L. Alder&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;ldquo;Anger is an essential part of being human. People are taught to deny themselves anger, and in this, they are actually opening themselves up to hate. The more you deny yourself the freedom to be angry, the more you will hate. Let yourself be angry, and hate will disintegrate, and when hate disintegrates, forgiveness prevails! The more you deny that you are angry, in attempts to be &amp;quot;holy&amp;quot; the more inhuman you will become, and the more inhuman you will become, the harder it will be to forgive.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	― C. JoyBell C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;quot;Pain and anger is a great fire starter. A great element that will get you going. The thing is though, pain and anger causes burn-out. You can&amp;rsquo;t be running on adrenaline for too long or it will totally burn you out. Anger starts the fire and it gets you going but love is what keeps you going. The love of what you do and why you do it. Anger starts the fire. Love keeps it burning.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	People won&amp;#39;t have time for you if you are always angry or complaining.&lt;br /&gt;
	―&amp;nbsp;Stephen Hawking&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Sometimes, you have to get angry to get things done.&lt;br /&gt;
	―&amp;nbsp;Ang Lee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Anger is a prelude to courage.&lt;br /&gt;
	―&amp;nbsp;Eric Hoffer&lt;/p&gt;
