	thick and the thin, we&amp;#39;ve done it together&lt;br /&gt;
	nothing has changed, we&amp;#39;re still the same&lt;br /&gt;
	you and me we would never change&lt;br /&gt;
	but everything changed, it changed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	fourteen long years that we spent together&lt;br /&gt;
	but now we&amp;#39;re apart, always apart&lt;br /&gt;

	i loved her but she did not love me&lt;br /&gt;
	she told me stop with my games&lt;br /&gt;
	the flowers, cards, candy, hugs and notes were free&lt;br /&gt;
	i guess i was the one to blame&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
	Stalker&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	You order your coffee at 10:18&lt;br /&gt;
	Snuggle in your jacket as you watch the steam&lt;br /&gt;
	Come off of the machine&lt;br /&gt;
	You know what I mean&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Sippin on that latte and you&amp;#39;re in the park&lt;br /&gt;
	Watching you quietly, I&amp;#39;m in the dark&lt;br /&gt;
	You&amp;#39;re with a different guy every day&lt;br /&gt;
	I tell myself that&amp;#39;s ok&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I don&amp;#39;t know - I want to -&amp;nbsp;I feel like I have to&lt;br /&gt;
	I don&amp;#39;t know - I want to - I feel like I have to&lt;br /&gt;
	I can stop whenever I want to - she don&amp;#39;t want you&lt;br /&gt;
	I can stop whenever I want to - she don&amp;#39;t want you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Golden and flowing, you tie your hair&lt;br /&gt;
	Well you have to be going but you stop and stare&lt;br /&gt;
	At my corner of the room&lt;br /&gt;
	How can this be true?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Feet turn to miles, you float on air&lt;br /&gt;
	I saw that smile and I know you care&lt;br /&gt;
	Till I see him leave his seat&lt;br /&gt;
	With a hug and a kiss to greet you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I don&amp;#39;t know - I want to - I feel like I have to&lt;br /&gt;
	I don&amp;#39;t know - I want to - I feel like I have to&lt;br /&gt;
	I can stop whenever I want to - she don&amp;#39;t want you&lt;br /&gt;
	I can stop whenever I want to - she don&amp;#39;t want you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Back at my &amp;#39;partment I&amp;#39;m in my bed&lt;br /&gt;
	Fluff up my pillow and I lay my head&lt;br /&gt;
	And go asleep to dream&lt;br /&gt;
	you know what I mean&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	Set my alarm and now I&amp;#39;m drifting off&lt;br /&gt;
	right then and there you know I dreamt the thought&lt;br /&gt;
	Cause I only dream of you&lt;br /&gt;
	And you know that my love is true&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	I don&amp;#39;t know - I want to - I feel like I have to&lt;br /&gt;
	I don&amp;#39;t know - I want to - I feel like I have to&lt;br /&gt;
	I can stop whenever I want to - she don&amp;#39;t want you&lt;br /&gt;
	I can stop whenever I want to - she don&amp;#39;t want you&lt;/p&gt;
