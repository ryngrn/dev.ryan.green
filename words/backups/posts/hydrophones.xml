	&amp;nbsp;- In the early 1950s, the Navy started installing hydrophone cables on the ocean floor.&lt;br /&gt;
	- The underwater microphones pick up sounds that are transmitted back to shore and converted into a visual display.&lt;br /&gt;
	- Because low-frequency sounds travel great distances in water, hydrophones can pick up noise generated by faraway underwater explosions.&lt;br /&gt;
	- Trained technicians can identify the sounds, determine whether a passing sub was diesel- or nuclear-powered, and to whom it likely belonged .&lt;/p&gt;
