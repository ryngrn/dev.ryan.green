	&lt;br /&gt;
	First, let me say that I highly appreciate the amount of effort that was put into this article and will look forward to Part II, if the author is not jaded or burnt out from his experiences in the comments and can continue.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	A line of research posits the raison d&amp;rsquo;etre of reason itself as argumentation, so it is not surprising that the author, who has put so much work into the article, would defend his position so staunchly. Still, yes, it could be done in a more emotionally intelligent manner. That is something that will come with experience and emotional maturity. The experience of anger or extreme motivation and the resulting hashing it out in the comments will eventually get old, and the author will realize that argumentation can be civilized, even refined. That, my friend, is collaboration, even creative critique in other circles. The relationships just such an environment can foster in the comments is what makes a blogger. In general women are much better at that.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Design is communication, regardless of its medium. Master its many objects, tools, and methods but even more so its many channels.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In the process, in design in general, in each individual&amp;rsquo;s goals and means of accomplishing them, there is no fact. Fact is a myth. As is perfection. People differ. And there are always just-as-good alternatives. Rigidity of approach or solution will lead to missed opportunities and lost insight. Fact oppresses more than it empowers. Be wary of its promises.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	In the case of LL Bean, sales are likely boosted by multiple overlapping taxonomic systems in the same horizontal menu. Understanding the differences between individual psychologies is likely the key to employing such a device, as not all users are left-brain, &amp;lsquo;one category to rule them&amp;rsquo; men. Some are shoe-wearing women. And their browsing patterns are more important than your, just the lowly designer&amp;rsquo;s, skewed understanding and mental model. IA cannot be devoid of UX, as information, no matter the architecture, is really only data if not aesthetically usable.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	When creating rigid systems like &amp;ldquo;&amp;ldquo;Footwear &amp;rarr; For Men&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;Men &amp;rarr; Footwear&amp;rdquo;&amp;rdquo;, then, try to take the other perspective. Analyze your discourse &amp;ndash; it holds power over you.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Along that same vein, common sense is as mythical as fact &amp;ndash; it really isn&amp;rsquo;t held in common. It changes from person to person, from demographic to demographic, hence personas. And it can be educated, just like Donald Norman&amp;rsquo;s Visceral &amp;gt; Behavioral &amp;gt; Reflective emotional design, and educated uniquely. Listening to the many voices of the voiceless your &amp;lsquo;common sense fact&amp;rsquo; oppresses will make you a much better designer. Diversity is a gift.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	May we all be existential connoisseurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	From my perspective (Colbenson.com where we work on findability mostly for style and fashion for stores like zara, mango or adoreme ), I believe Search shall share a balanced and unified level with navigation.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	If we see Search and Navigation as non-connected aspects of Information Architecture then we making a common mistake.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Don&amp;rsquo;t you think that defining an Information Architecture is more of a bottom up approach? The naming, order, position, graphical aid and depth of category nodes is dictated by user demand.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Is all about empathy, about hitting names for categories and logic that dissolves with People&amp;rsquo;s intentions (whether they are driven by a desire or by a commitment).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	I believe we can&amp;rsquo;t set a &amp;ldquo;primary or sole mean of navigation&amp;rdquo;, and is not about navigating, nor about searching, is about either discovering or locating.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Most online stores fail to deliver an experience that is optimized for these two types of intentions (discovering and locating).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	When you don&amp;rsquo;t know what you want you tend to click or navigate, but not necessarily on taxonomies, when you do know what you want then you demand a shortcut and search is then utilized. This is why as an average Site Search Conversion is 4 times Navigation Conversion (most stores don&amp;rsquo;t even know this). On mobile this is 7 times higher (on our experience).&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	To be honest, I don&amp;rsquo;t like how the conversation goes and how is it that our industry continues to produce such poor non-emotionally driven user experiences. In the future all these samples will be seen as horrendous deliverables!&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	The good thing is that everything is to be done ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Just to clarify:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Is not one single intention landing on a page and requiring therefore Navigation or Search to find. There are various intentions that could be grouped in:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	a) Browser: Does not know. &amp;ldquo;Lets see what&amp;rsquo;s on&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	b) Committed: Knows. &amp;ldquo;I want this, or feel like that&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Evidently one can be a Browser and then a Committed ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	--------------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	A search box has no scent in the absence of at least a partial unigram + autocomplete. It only works well when the user knows a few terms about what he wants. It works much less well for discovery or if the subject is difficult to describe for the searcher or has many synonyms. Sophistication can get around some of the synonym problem, but even Google struggles.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	There are some interesting blends, though. There&amp;rsquo;s auto-complete and its friends. Some sites show products and categories as well in that list. That works well to improve scent. Lots of people go straight for the search box, but in the context of faceted search the user is then free to combine a search with a category &amp;amp; facets.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	So it&amp;rsquo;s not either or. A user could type in a vague query like &amp;ldquo;camera,&amp;rdquo; and then select &amp;ldquo;Cameras &amp;gt; Digital Cameras.&amp;rdquo; Then he could select &amp;ldquo;Sony.&amp;rdquo; A robust IA doesn&amp;rsquo;t prevent the full use of all taxonomies from keyword search: Some IAs allow for &amp;ldquo;search within&amp;rdquo; within a category as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	---------&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	In practice, I term the main taxonomy the &amp;ldquo;category tree.&amp;rdquo; I call everything else a &amp;ldquo;facet.&amp;rdquo; Those facets that behave like categories in that values can be browsed to in the absence of a category selection, I call &amp;ldquo;browsable facets.&amp;rdquo; See http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/08/categories-facetsand-browsable-facets.php . Technically they&amp;rsquo;re all taxonomies. I guess you could call them categories, but I avoid using that term for anything other than the main category tree for clarity reasons. Usually, it goes like this:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	1. There is 1 category taxonomy. It&amp;rsquo;s usually a tree.&lt;br /&gt;
	2. Everything else is usually non-hierarchical taxonomy (a facet). That&amp;rsquo;s out of necessity. It&amp;rsquo;s difficult to present multiple hierarchical taxonomies because of the &amp;ldquo;split ends&amp;rdquo; problem anyway. Technically a facet could have hierarchy, but in practice they usually do not, or only in a limited way, for this reason.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Browsable facets contain values that a different mental model might prefer as a first decision. Usually it goes like this:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	1. They cover most products. Think brand or material.&lt;br /&gt;
	2. They could reasonably be conceived as categories. I also say they&amp;rsquo;re &amp;ldquo;surrogate categories,&amp;rdquo; but I picked browsable as the term because &amp;ldquo;values can be browsed to in the absence of a category selection.&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Someone here said:&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;gt; For example, it is true that even on a mainstream site users sometimes&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;gt; arrive with a very specific mindset, such as &amp;ldquo;I want anything that is low fat&amp;rdquo;.&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;gt; But even those users will have to divide their meals at some point into low-fat&lt;br /&gt;
	&amp;gt; breakfast, snack, dessert, salad, etc&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	Respectfully, I believe this is false. We have to draw the line somewhere, but we can&amp;rsquo;t presume to know the intent &amp;amp; priorities of the user. Someone on a low-fat diet may be looking for ideas.&lt;br /&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	And hasn&amp;rsquo;t everyone eaten pizza for breakfast at least once?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
	&lt;br /&gt;
	------------&lt;/p&gt;
